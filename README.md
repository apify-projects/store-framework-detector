# Solution template
This repository serves as a template for creating repositories for new solutions. Using a template makes it easier to create new repos with pre-defined contents and ensures consistency between the repositories.

## How to use this template

1. Click the Use this template button in the top right corner.
2. Choose a name for the repository. It should be in the format `vendor`-`customer`-`solution`-`...`. 
   - **Examples:**
   - apify-thorn-facebook-scraper
   - topmonks-microsoft-google-scraper
   - topmonks-microsoft-google-data-processor
   - devbros-apple-some-codename-scraper
3. Make sure the repo is **private**.
4. Create the repo.

**Once you have the repo created:**

1. Go to Settings -> Manage Access -> Invite teams or people.
2. Add the **Apify Team** as **admin**. If the solution will be delivered by a partner, add their team as **admin** too.
4. Edit this README and fill in the details in the template below. If a field cannot be filled, write **N/A**.
5. Finally, delete this guide from the Readme, so that only the newly added details will remain.
6. You're done! Thanks for using the template!
